              Vector-quantized networks (VQNs) have exhibited remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they are
              prone to training instability, which complicates the training process due to the necessity for techniques
              such as subtle initialization and model distillation. In this study, we identify the local minima issue as
              the primary cause of this instability. To address this, we integrate an optimal transport method in place
              of the nearest neighbor search to achieve a more globally informed assignment. We introduce
              <b style="color: red">OptVQ</b>, a novel vector quantization method that employs the Sinkhorn algorithm to
              optimize the optimal transport problem, thereby enhancing the stability and efficiency of the training
              process. To mitigate the influence of diverse data distributions on the Sinkhorn algorithm, we implement a
              straightforward yet effective normalization strategy. Our comprehensive experiments on image
              reconstruction tasks demonstrate that OptVQ achieves <b>100%</b> codebook utilization and surpasses
              current state-of-the-art VQNs in reconstruction quality.

              The vector-quantized networks (VQNs), initially proposed for image distribution modeling, has since been
              expanded with enhanced architectures and training strategies. Specifically, the conventional vector
              quantization calculates the Euclidean distance between data features $\mathbf{Z}$ and the codebook
              $\mathcal{C}$, with each feature selecting the closest codebook token as its discrete representation.
              Given the non-backpropagatable nature of the nearest neighbor operation, VQNs approximate the data feature
              gradient through copying the codebook's gradient during training (i.e., straight-through gradient
              estimation). Despite their significance, VQNs present training challenges, notably the <b>"index
                collapse"</b> phenomenon. Conventional VQNs, akin to parameterized online K-Means algorithms, are
              susceptible to local optima. The nearest neighbor operation is a greedy strategy, often leading to the
              selection of only a few peripheral codebooks, while the majority remain unused. To address this,
              researchers have proposed solutions such as subtle initialization, distillation strategies, and
              lower-dimensional codebooks. However, we posit that the training difficulties of VQNs are inherent to the
              local convergence issues of K-Means algorithms. A quantization strategy leveraging the global structure of
              data is essential to evade these local pitfalls.
            </p>
            <p>
              We propose a novel vector quantization strategy,
              <b style="color: red">OptVQ</b>, which leverages global structure information between data and codebook
              for quantization. Inspired by optimal transport theory, we frame vector quantization as an optimal
              transport problem. The objective is to learn a mapping from data to the codebook that minimizes the
              overall transportation cost. To address this problem with efficiency, we utilize the Sinkhorn-Knopp
              algorithm to optimize the transport problem. Theoretical research confirms that the Sinkhorn algorithm can
              achieve near-optimal assignment results with significant efficiency. However, it is imperative to
              recognize that the Sinkhorn algorithm's performance is sensitive to the range of data values. Our research
              reveals that a straightforward yet effective normalization technique can mitigate this sensitivity. Our
              extensive experiments have demonstrated that OptVQ ensures 100% codebook utilization and surpasses current
              state-of-the-art vector quantization methods in image reconstruction tasks. OptVQ not only enhances the
              quality of reconstruction but also achieves training stability without the need for complex training
              techniques such as subtle initialization or distillation.

              We propose a novel vector quantizer by employing a global search method instead of the nearest neighbor
              search. Optimal transport theory is dedicated to solving the optimal mapping
              problem between two distributions. The core concept is that by minimizing a certain cost, we can map one
              distribution onto another, effectively addressing our local pitfall issue in VQ. Specifically, for the
              codebook $\mathbf{C} = [\mathbf{c}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{c}_n] \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ and the features
              to be assigned $\mathbf{Z} = [\mathbf{z}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{z}_l] \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times l}$, we seek an
              assignment matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}_+^{l \times n}$ that not only respects the order of distances
              between codes and features, but also ensures maximal participation of each code and feature. This can be
              formulated as the following optimization problem:
              $\min_{\mathbf{A}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{D}) - \frac{1}{\epsilon} H(\mathbf{A}) \tag{1} \\ s.t.,
              ~ \mathbf{A} \mathbf{1}_r = \mathbf{1}_r, \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{1}_c = \mathbf{1}_c, \mathbf{A} \in
              \mathbb{R}_+^{l \times n},$
              where $\mathbf{D} \in \mathbb{R}_+^{l\times n} (\mathbf{D}_ij = \Vert \mathbf{z}_i - \mathbf{c}_j \Vert)$
              is the distance matrix between codes and features, $H(\mathbf{A}) = - \sum_{ij} \mathbf{A}_{ij} \log
              \mathbf{A}_{ij}$ is the entropy function, $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter, and $\mathbf{1}_r$ and
              $\mathbf{1}_c$ are vectors of ones for the rows and columns, respectively. The objective function
              $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{D})$ ensures that the assignment matrix $\mathbf{A}$ adheres to the order
              of distances between codes and features, while the entropy term $H(\mathbf{A})$ and the constraints ensure
              that all codes and features are considered in the assignment process. By selecting an appropriate value
              for $\epsilon$, a good balance can be achieved between maintaining the order of distances and ensuring a
              globally informed assignment. The larger the value of $\mathbf{A}_{ij}$, the greater the tendency for
              feature $\mathbf{z}_i$ to be assigned to code $\mathbf{c}_j$. Thus, the OptVQ algorithm we propose is as
              follows:
              $\mathbf{z}_q = h(\mathbf{z}_i) = \mathbf{c}_k, \quad \text{where} \quad k = \arg \max_{j}
              \mathbf{A}_{ij}. \tag{2}$
              When the data distribution is significantly inconsistent with the codebook distribution, the entropy
              function and constraint term in OptVQ play a crucial role in ensuring that each code and feature
              participate fully in the assignment, thereby avoiding the local pitfall issue. As training progresses and
              the distributions of data and codebook gradually overlap (i.e., there exists a code $\mathbf{c}_j$ such
              that the distance to feature $\mathbf{z}_i$ is close to $0$), the solution to Equ.(1) will tend towards a
              one-hot format, where $\mathbf{A}_{ij} > 0$ and $\mathbf{A}_{ik} = 0$ for all $k\neq j$, in which OptVQ
              aligns with the conventional VQ method. Subsequent experiments verify that our proposed OptVQ effectively
              solves the local pitfalls of conventional VQ and basically achieves 100% codebook utilization. For
              efficient optimization of the optimal transport problem, we employ the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. For more

              To elucidate the ability of OptVQ to resolve local pitfalls in VQNs, we depict the dynamic training
              trajectory in a two-dimensional context. We initiate $100$ data points and $25$ codes at random, where the
              vanilla VQ with the nearest neighbor method is denoted by red and OptVQ with the optimal transport method
              is denoted by green. It is evident that vanilla VQ is markedly influenced by the initial distribution,
              engaging predominantly with codes located at the distribition's extremities. In contrast, OptVQ
              effectively harnesses the global structure, resulting in an equitable matching between data points and
              codes.

              We compare the optimal transport operation with the nearest neighbor across varying conditions, including
              different latent dimensions and codebook sizes. These experiments are conducted on a 1% subset of ImageNet
              for efficiency. The conventional VQ-VAE experiences a substantial decrease in codebook utilization as the
              codebook size increases, plummeting below 1%. In contrast, OptVQ consistently maintains a 100% codebook
              utilization, leading to a marked improvement in reconstruction performance with an expanding codebook
              size.

            <p>
              We probe the convergence of the Sinkhorn algorithm, adhering to the same settings with $\epsilon=10$. We
              randomly simulated $10$ data points and $10$ codes with a dimension of $16$, and then execute the Sinkhorn
              algorithm to scrutinize the $\mathbf{A}^t$ matrix post each iteration. Our observations reveal that the
              values in $\mathbf{A}^t$ progressively converge as the number of iterations increases. Notably, the
              Sinkhorn algorithm has achieved convergence by the fifth iteration. Thus, a relatively small number of
              iterations suffices to yield a reasonably accurate solution for the optimal transport problem.
